Date: 12 August 2024

You are the only surviving member of your friend group, and you’re stuck in this house with the man who murdered all of them. Escape will be difficult, but you’ve still got some chances to get out of this in one piece, or take him down with you. 

Final Girl Simulator is a survival horror game that works in relatively short rounds of PvE against an AI Slasher. The game is in first person, set in a procedurally generated house with a randomly selected Slasher. The object of the game will be to find items, construct traps, and kill The Slasher before it can kill you.
# Core Identity
---
## Gameplay
---
In order to make this game stand out, I really want to focus on building traps in order to lure The Slasher to its death. My hope is that this game will feel like a mix of home alone and a more traditional survival horror. Consider the main inspiration of this game the frustration that comes with watching a horror movie, and realizing the characters have full access to both a normal lighter and a can of hairspray but haven’t put any effort into solving their problems with them.
## Themes
---
The more time I spend with this game, the more time I want to put into the higher concepts and themes of it. While it may be enough to just make a fun horror game, I think some careful attention to our themes will go a long way. I think it could be easy to fall into some harmful tropes of the horror genre or to fumble the bag with tone. As such I would like to approach this game with a bit of a critical feminist lens, and lean into the inherent campiness of horror.
### Feminism

When I say feminism here, I mean it in the academic way. The trope of Final Girl comes up a lot, and often when a slasher film leaves a Final Girl, it’s after a long trail of murder. These dead characters are portrayed as having deserved it in some way, either being deeply unlikeable or sexually active in a way that is punished by the narrative. Often, Final Girl is left because she was the most worthy one to live. In reality when tragedy strikes it’s often pure luck that leaves survivors, not virtue.

In this iteration of the Final Girl the player is not getting any sort of catharsis from the deaths of the other victims. Instead the dead characters act more like support for the player, with their belongings left behind as the only source of hope for the now isolated player. Even in death these other characters can still have personalities and support for the final girl by leaving personal items behind that can then be turned against their murderer with vengeance. 

 By allowing the player to pick which one of the characters to play, and having the rest be dead, we can absolve the narrative of moral judgment against these characters, and allow their different traits to be either what saved them, or what helps save their last remaining friend. 
### Camp

Attempting to define camp is like attempting to define art as a whole—an exercise in futility. For the sake of clarity, I will try anyway. Since this is not so serious, if you’ve never heard the term it might be worth skimming the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_(style)#:~:text=Camp%20may%20have%20derived%20from,play%20Les%20Fourberies%20de%20Scapin). In this instance we can understand camp in part as acknowledging and emphasizing the stereotypes of the genre. It embraces the overtop nature of horror and recognizes the artifice of the game. I think it’s imperative that we not take ourselves too seriously.

In this case, Camp and Comedy will go hand in hand. This game should invoke the same feeling as booting up Tubi, navigating to the B Horror section, and selecting something from the 1980s. It needs to be fun, it needs to be schlocky, but it still needs to be sincere in regard to the theme. 

Making it not so serious in its tone will help balance the horror with the action of the game. Where there is no action, there should be horror, and where there is action there should be places to find comedy. My concern is that if the game doesn’t have an inherently comedic undertone to it that we can recognize and cultivate, comedy will find its way out in uncontrolled ways and undermine the immersion of the game. Having the capacity to fight back against a horror scenario, and having enemy AI that will stumble into traps both have potential to be goofy in a way that either breaks immersion or tension. By finding other ways to relieve that comedic pressure we will hopefully be able to roll with that comedy.

At the end of the day, I think this game will succeed if it doesn’t take itself seriously and leans into the parts of it that would make it fail as a purely horror title.
# Pillars
---
**Evasion** - The Slasher is the player’s primary threat. In order to survive the player must be monitoring and playing around what The Slasher does. It should be threatening but manageable.

**Improvisation** - The player should always be on the lookout for items in the environment to aid them in crafting traps. Ideally there’s not going to be one easy solution to get someone out of every problem, instead they have to be scrappy and silly with what they put together, and it should leave them feeling very smart about what they’ve done.

**Replayability** - With so much room for error the round should be short and sweet, leaving the player with a lot of opportunity and incentive to get back into the game and try something different.
# Environmental Elements
---
When the player spawns in they will be faced with a house, either pre built or procedurally generated.
### Prebuilt

Pros: 
- Would allow for more intentional trap locations to be set by the devs
- And more interesting maps and evasion routes

Cons:
- Could lead to stale gameplay as the map would no longer be an exploration factor
### Procedural

Pros: 
- would force the player to think on their feet more
- Could end up with more dead-end scenarios 

Cons:
- Less intentional game design could lead to more janky experiences

Either way, within this house will spawn a number of items based on difficulty that will allow the player to combine items into traps and weapons. There will also be a number of locations where traps can be set to catch The Slasher.

# Main Game Loop
---
Explore a Room → Pick up Item or Information → Explore larger Area → Evade Slasher → Build a Trap → Plant a trap → Lure the Slasher

This game loop will function in phases as the pressure ratchets up during a run. There wouldn’t be any visible indication of this, but rather the game should encourage the player to move on to the next phase as they become ready. It’s possible that they could get caught off guard and have to execute a plan while they still think they’re in the Exploration phase.

- Exploration
- The first stretch where you find most of your stuff and get an idea of the layout
- Evasion
- The Slasher starts to get aggressive, now is when you’d better have a plan one way or another
- Execution
- Either you make your way out, or get your trap working

This loop could be repeated until the game ends, depending on how successful the player is at setting traps and evading the Slasher, but it should become more and more difficult to evade as time goes on.

## Health Meter:

What it says on the tin, really. You can be hurt by objects and traps in the game, and also the Slasher.
### Alternatively

Health could be done away with altogether. This would make The Slasher an instant kill, and lead to traps applying debuffs and making noises if set off by the player. This would make The Slasher more threatening, and lead to more immediate consequences to setting off your own trap
## Panic Meter:

Slowly increases as time passes, or while you’re doing stressful tasks. It makes you louder but also makes your attacks do more damage if you decide to start swinging - Effectively puts a timer on the mission as you won’t be able to indefinitely keep up with Panic ticks. Low panic also makes trap building faster (and maybe more effective?) 
### Alternatively

Panic could work on thresholds, putting the player into a state of either Paniced or Calm. The Panic state would involve louder noises, worse handling but faster speed, an inability to set traps and increased weapon damage.
## Trap Building/Items:

You’ll be able to find items scattered throughout the house that can be combined and placed within rooms to lure the Slasher to his death. While some weapons may spawn, fighting the slasher head on without a premeditated trap and/or plan will end in disaster for the player. In the game play, it's important the player balances their time with trap making and item collecting. Just hitting the Slasher is not going to be enough, as he will only take damage if he is currently in a trap. This should force the player to engage more with the unique aspects of this game instead of relying on more conventional weapons. 
## Slasher AI:

Should be scalable, but sort of dumb. At the end of the day this is going to be a little goofy no matter what so we might as well lean into a wee bit of comedy with the horror

Good at finding you, good at killing you, but terrible at avoiding traps - Escaping the map should be harder than setting traps, if we include it as an option at all.

Several different Slashers with different AI variations and behaviors could also help keep players on their toes and force them into different strategies.

# Items/Interactables![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf1UQ2H7EVm8OXwjZ9PHzp312FU0R-sMr_t2m_afkbjOuq58mGHWabL24yQUiAXPGG5QV8QUrkrbiucMsoFrXTvWBnEjm5ayYK6N99sci6VgHIm8kuS2n8hz-gy6sn-Mecj-ead_w_73riQEPQvV9iluXf8?key=NKGFogHep8dL4S91619Dpw)

## Trap Components

- Lighter
- Hair Spray
- Flammable! In spray form!
- Gasoline
- Flammable! 
- Can be used to refuel something like a car if we decide to include escape methods. 
- Pool noodles!
- Combine them with Gasoline for a fun surprise that will help us later
- (Dissolving polymers in gasoline will make something close to napalm)
- Bleach and Ammonia 
- As separate items that are tied in their spawn, so if you find one you know to go looking for the other.
- :) you’ll need ‘em both!
- (this makes mustard gas. Don’t combine cleaning chemicals irl please)
- Candles 
- For magic or fuse timers
- Concrete
- Either fill it in a paint can
- Or lure the Slasher into stepping into it and getting entombed
- Marbles!
- A sure fire way to make someone trip
- (Home alone his ass by leaving them at the top of some stairs. The simplest and easiest trap)
- Won’t be the most damage, but it would knock down a decent amount of The Slasher’s health
- It would be good to combo this with another trap at the bottom of the stairs
- Fishing Line
- For trip wires
- Mouse trap 
- Also for a tripping mechanism
- Iron
- Requires the power to be on, but can be used as either a fuse timer by burning something
- Or deal damage directly, again home alone style
## Keys

Unlock ways out or information

- A Dungeon Master’s Ultimate Trap Guide
- Unlocks a random selection of crafting options, preferably based on what has spawned for this run. Also increases the damage of your traps
- Literal car keys, for getting a car running (may or may not need gas)
- Ritual Tome 
- Unlocks a couple of magic traps - all must be fueled with a bit of your own blood
- (So they’re high damage but come at a cost of health)
- Oars 
- Will allow you to use a boat escape if the house spawns with a basement with a boat dock dishonored style
- Doubles as a weapon if not
- Spare Fuses
- Get the power in the house running again
## Weapons

Some of these can be used as Trap Components but I”m giving them their own section anyway

- Axe
- Knife
- Baseball Bat with Nails!
- Shovel
- Get an achievement for killing the Slasher with a shovel, in reference to Reanimator
- Also you could dig a pit trap
- A hand grenade. 
- Very rare spawn, just instantly kills him. I just think it’d be so funny
- Maybe it has a pretty terrible success rate like blowing up in your hand or being a dud
## Other

- Energy Drinks
- Restores health but increases Panic
- Stuffed animal
- Reduces Panic as long as it stays in your inventory
# Other Quirks

- The bodies of your friends can be found but they’ll increase your Panic Meter and make you louder - but they often have the best loot, maybe some already assembled trap components
- If we have other characters they could appear as corpses
- Anything can be crafted without the recipe, so if you remember things from old runs or get a little silly with it you can build anything. But recipes exist and are unlockable to you will also have guides - not as a pop-up though, just somewhere decently easy to find within menus.
- You could have a journal that tracks information as you use it - ie you build a flamethrower and the recipe shows up in your journal. This would persist throughout runs but never be mandatory. Like the journal in Phasmophobia, it’s just for reference.  
- Your traps will also deal damage to you.
- You should get an achievement for killing yourself
- And there should be a simple way to move through your own traps without setting them off, like sneaking while going through them. Or jumping over them which creates noise but prevents you from getting hit
- While you can navigate with WASD, you can interact with the environment by clicking on objects, either adding them to your inventory, interacting with them in the environment, or adding information to a section of your inventory. 
- You can set save files, but each run should be short, so they won’t be a necessary feature. However, having easy save files will encourage the player to try stupid things more often, which will add to the comedy of the game.  - we’re going for something like the ending of Death Trips where the monster eats shit and dies [https://forameuss.itch.io/death-trips](https://forameuss.itch.io/death-trips) 
# Aesthetics
---
This game should be in first person, with a cool color palette to allow for bright unnatural pops of colors in both the environment and in vfx like blood splatters. This could take a couple of forms: 

- A 2.5D style game with a lot of focus on textures and color and less focus on the models, similar to [Cryptmaster](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1885110/Cryptmaster/) but in full color (characters modeled in full, backgrounds handled with very simple models and more complicated textures) 
- A fully 3D game with low poly assets and pixelated textures. Perhaps with the look and feel of a ps 2 style game. [Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUiyph17F3A)

It might be fun to reference makeup packaging in our ui/ux design - to try to make some of the stylings really read as something targeted towards highschool or college age women.


Possible specifics:

- VHS style post-processing
- Cherry red or magenta blood
- Making our shadows cool-toned and dark, but never too black to fully see.

### Lethal Company

[Steam Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966720/Lethal_Company/)

While not at all in line with game play or aesthetic, Lethal Company is a great demonstration of how to blend horror and comedy together into a cohesive end product. Where Lethal Company relies on the players and their interactions to produce the majority of its goofs, it sets them up well and then executes a tonal shift of comedy once the player is alone. For instance, there are some extra spooky sounds that only play when a player has sufficient distance from the rest of their party. 

I think it’s also a good example of horror and comedy being two sides of the same coin. Both forms rely heavily on regulating the player’s emotions and being in control of tension and the release of pressure.
### Phasmophobia

[Steam Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/)

An even more tenuous link, but Phasmophobia always takes place in specifically built maps, but with random ghosts. While the ghosts are pulled from a set, and figuring them out is the whole game, we could draw inspiration from the variations in The Slasher’s AI. This could serve as a jumping off point for making each of The Slasher unique and interesting and adding to the replayability factor. 
### Happy Death Day

It’s a fun movie that balances the tone of comedy and horror very well. Shows a murder victim through several time loops, until she solves her own murder and kills her murderer. Not exactly campy, but very fun with good tonal balance. Good study on how to balance the two genres without the influence of other players.
### Resident Evil 4

At risk of sounding extremely derivative, of course every horror game since 2005 has in some way reference RE4. Specifically though, I really like how they handle inventory management. I don’t think the zen nature of sorting your inventory is going to be applicable to this game, but maybe swap the briefcase out for some tiny pockets and a purse and now you’ve got an added pressure of juggling all the stuff you find around the house. Not just limited to you can only hold x amount of items, but rather you only have so much space, and combining items will reduce the amount of space they take up. This might pressure players into experimenting with weird combos on the fly.
### Hello Neighbor

We should in no way emulate Hello Neighbor. I think the neighbor’s AI is an interesting place to start, and it was well praised in alpha versions. Most importantly though, I think we can use Hello Neighbor as a handbook on what not to do.

### Feminist Frameworks for Horror Films - Cynthia A Freeland

[Pdf link](https://docdrop.org/static/drop-pdf/Freeland-Horror-Films-vvgRz_ocr.pdf)

Honestly this article is sort of a banger to read if you love seeing academics beef with each other. It also serves as a decent primer for reading horror in a feminist lens. Definitely not required reading for this project, but very interesting nonetheless. Provides some criticism of more traditional feminist theory, as well as some alternatives and examples of intersectionality.
