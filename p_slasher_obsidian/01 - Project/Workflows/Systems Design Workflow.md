# Systems Design Overview
---
Systems Design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interface, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements, or, the understanding of component parts and their subsequent interaction with one another. Functionally, systems design is the blueprint for game design elements (mechanics).

Systems designers, as opposed to systems design, are game designers who focus on these particular details when designing game elements. This is both a design philosophy as well as implementation standards. 
# High Level to Low Level  Design
---
During the design phase, designers should consider several key points: high level design (HLD) and low level design (LLD). HLD explains the relationships and desired behaviors abstractly while LLD focuses on the more granular/specific process such as how to implement the given system.

Creative directors or systems game design leads may articulate the architecture for various game design implementations (HLD) while systems designers implement the target design (LLD). The implementation of these designs (level designers, content designers, etc.) help other game designers understand the systems, how to use the systems, and how to adjust the systems.

Having a strong understanding of object oriented programming will help designers immensely and make the lives of engineers so much easier. It'll also help designers make informed decisions when designing complex game systems. As a whole, Torchfire Studios (at least for Unity projects) a composition over inheritance approach (when best applicable of course) which emphasizes the 
# Prototyping
---
The main functional purpose of utilizing proper systems design techniques is to reduce tech debt (bugs, refactoring, etc.) due to changing specifications and concrete articulation of design details. Since systems design is very linear where implementation comes at the end of the process, it is encouraged for designers to prototype parallel to their designs. Designers should consider all stages of prototyping for a given mechanic if it helps them build and design. Look into "Prototyping Mechanics" in the [[Game Prototyping Workflow]] note for more details on how you might best prototype designs (rapid and draft prototypes are typical). At the end of the process, however, we should have a proper tech demo for a given mechanic.
