# Game Prototyping Overview
---
A game prototype is a test of sorts - a way to explore a concept and prove it is viable. Before taking a game to production, the primary gameplay elements need to be created (otherwise other designers have nothing to work with). In chunks, we will be able to prove viability for a gameplay concept building the necessary architecture for production. 
# Types of Prototyping
---
### Rapid Prototype
---
The cheapest version of prototyping, the rapid prototype is intended to be the quickest method to bring the concept to life. This manifests in many ways depending on the concept but can look like drawing on index cards or using your finger to move. Be loose with this and should communicate the idea rather than focus on cleaning up the mess. 
### Draft Prototype
---
After the rapid prototype is complete, the designers should have a lot of confidence in moving forward. Now, we want to bring this idea into the engine. The designers need to combine target mechanics together and showcase them working together. While the systems may not be perfect and bug free, this prototype should be playable and give a wider audience a solid understanding of the game. 
### Tech Prototype
---
When the draft is completed and verified, the team needs to rebuild the draft using proper architecture and proper systems. 
# Prototyping Mechanics
---
Game prototypes will often consists of several mechanics. Each mechanic could (and in some cases, should) be designed individually and tested individually. Designers will need to understand and document the relationships a given mechanic has with another. Each mechanic may have it's own rapid, draft, and tech phases of prototyping - consider this when working on a prototype.
