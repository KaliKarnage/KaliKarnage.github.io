# What is Obsidian?
---
"Obsidian is the private and flexible writing app that adapts to the way you think." -Obsidian

Whatever that means. Obsidian is a note taking app that is simple, yet extremely versatile. It fully uses markdown for syntax but is open source where several creators have added many plugins to add many new features. 

Obsidian functions like a wiki allowing you to link notes with other notes. For example, if I have a comment about the [[Fleeting Note System]] I can reference it right in this note. Give it a click. It takes you right there.

There is also a graph feature that helps you visualize your notes and find connecting threads. Additionally, the canvas feature allows you to do similar things to Figjam!

# Why are we using Obsidian?
---
Partly for the fact that navigating google drive is a mess, but also because it is easy to access over the cloud. We host this 'vault' on GitHub along with our game project to ensure they are close to each other. It'll help us reference designs and other notes via the GitHub project board as well. 

Another reason is that the Obsidian tool is extremely beneficial to a large team. The backlink system is what I am specifically looking at. We will use this system like a wiki which will allow designers and developers quickly navigate what will be a large quantity of designs, redesigns, and artifacts.

# How do we use obsidian?
---
Firstly, we have a file system, but it is not super granular. 
- 00 - Maps of Content
	- Will function as a database of artifacts. If we have characters or items, we can log them here to quickly access.
- 01 - Project
	- Will contain all files pertaining to the operations for the project including project details and workflows
- 02 - Areas
	- I honestly don't know yet. This is a production folder and we haven't reached this stage yet. Open to suggestions for organizing what will be a mess of assets.
- 03 - Fleeting Notes
	- This is where most people's contributions will go. Any thought, idea, deep dive, study - you name it - will go here as a note. 
- 04 - Core Designs
	- What will be the home of primary game design details, notes from the fleeting note section will be mulled over by creative leads or the core team to cherry pick exactly what needs to be a core design. When that decision has been made, a new core design will be made and the used fleeting notes will go to 06
- 05 - Resources
	- This will home any terminology, research, or anything external to the project.
- 06 - Archive
	- Folder to contain notes that have moved on to the afterlife. Better than deleting certain notes where *perhaps* we want to reference or look at something from before - and can't.\
- 07 - Imported Assets
	- Any image or imported file should be cleaned up by being stored here. It will be preferential to name these imported files for easier multi-use/reference. 
- 08 - Templates
	- Over time, there will exist more and more templates to make creating new things quicker and easier. This may include templates for creating designed objects in the obsidian.

Each note should also have a specific heading. Consider this current note:

Line 1 is the note 'tag' which represents what kind of note this is. Workflow is an example of a note that consists of how to do or understand certain systems. Other examples may be 'art' or 'narrative'

Line 2 is the Author 'tag'. I tagged myself since I wrote it. You can click on these notes and it'll filter all of the notes relating to this tag. So, if you click on the author tag, you can see all the notes that person created.

Line 3 is the date. I use MLA format. We use MLA format. The date is important for designers and developers to see how recent a specific note is. Core Designs should be regularly updated/checked on to make sure our core designs don't become stale or we forget to change something and we lose track of where we are. We can also see if a note is really stale and determine if we need to keep the note around.
