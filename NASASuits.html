            <h1>What is NASA SUITS</h1>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>The NASA SUITS (Space Suit User Interface Technologies for Students) program is an initiative
                    designed to engage and inspire students by giving them the opportunity to design and create
                    spacesuit information displays within an augmented reality (AR) environment. This program is part of
                    NASA's efforts to foster innovation and technological development in the field of space exploration,
                    specifically focusing on the enhancement of astronaut spacesuits and their interfaces.</p>
                <p>Students participating in the NASA SUITS program are tasked with developing AR solutions that can be
                    integrated into the helmets of astronauts' spacesuits. These solutions aim to improve astronauts'
                    efficiency and safety by providing them with critical information through the helmet's display. This
                    could include navigation data, health and life support system statuses, and other environmental
                    readings crucial for spacewalks and other extravehicular activities.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6" id="col-2-suits">
                <p>The program is structured as a challenge, inviting teams from various universities and colleges to
                    submit their designs for evaluation. Selected teams are then invited to NASA's Johnson Space Center
                    to test their AR interfaces in simulated space environments, offering a hands-on experience that
                    closely mirrors real-world space exploration scenarios. This not only allows students to contribute
                    directly to NASA's space exploration efforts but also provides them with invaluable experience in
                    teamwork, problem-solving, and the application of AR technology in demanding environments.</p>
