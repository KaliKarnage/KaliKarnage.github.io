                    <p>I was born and raised in California. I lived in the bay area for most of my upbringing and in
                        2010 I graduated from San Mateo High School. In 2011 I decided to join the United States Air
                        Force where I served as a Security Policeman where I held positions as Patrolman,
                        Non-Commisioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC) of Anti-Terrorism, Investigator, Desk Sergeant, and
                        Facility Manager. While I was in I also earned my associate of applied science degree in
                        criminal justice. After 10 years of service I was medically discharged due to injuries sustained
                        during my service and I decided to move back to Idaho. Upon moving back to Idaho I deciced to
                        pursue my bachelors degree when I stumbled upon the Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile
                        Technology (GIMM) program at Boise State University(BSU) during my research of local schools.

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>Since my earliest memories, I've been captivated by video games and the magic that makes pixels
                        dance across the screen. This fascination only grew as I played games on various platforms,
                        including PC, consoles, arcade machines, and handhelds. Surrounded by people in the tech
                        industry while growing up, my interest in game development never truly left the back of my mind.

                        One pivotal moment came when I met the father of one of my childhood friends, a Marine turned
                        game developer who had contributed to titles like Gauntlet: Seven Sorrows. His journey inspired
                        me, and as time went on, I began to contemplate a transition from my military service in the Air
                        Force to a career in game development.

                        After my discharge from the Air Force, I decided to take the leap and pursue my dream. Boise
                        State University's GIMM program (Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile) was the perfect choice
                        for me, given my familiarity with Idaho and the eight years I had spent serving there.

                        This program provides me with the knowledge and skills needed to enter the world of game
                        development. While the transition from the military to a creative field like game development
                        may require some adjustments, I believe my military background has equipped me with valuable
                        qualities such as discipline, teamwork, and problem-solving. </p>
